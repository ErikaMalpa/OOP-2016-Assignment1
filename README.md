How my assignment works:

I highly recommend you wear headphones for the ambience!

1. There are 6 circle buttons that is blue. 
    - 1. Will be the "laser".
    - 2. Will show a pise chart which shows the user's "storage".
    - 3. Will show a clock.
    - 4. Will play a relaxing music that will be handy when the user will cruise around the space.
    - 5. Will stop both songs and the robot voices (activated when the three globes on the right is clicked).
    - 6. Will play an arcade song that is good when in combat.
    
2. There are 3 Globes on the right that is rotating, when you hover your mouse over it. It will make a sound and also what will it show. When all of them are clicked there will be a robbot voice reading it for you. If you want them to stop reading it for you. You must stop it by pressing the 5th blur circle button.
    - 1. Will show your mission.
    - 2. Will show your target.
    - 3. Will show your spaceship status.
    
3. The radar will automatically be playing a sound. If you want to pause it click the left side of the middle ellipse and if you want to play it again click the right side of the middle ellipse.

4. Press W and S to "move forward and backwards", the "speed" will be shown on the left ellipse and the "fuel" on the right. As you press w and s the moon and the planet will go big as if you're going towards it. Also the distance will increase if you press s and decrease as you press w as you are going close to it.
